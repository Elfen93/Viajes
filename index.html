            <h2>How to prepare a trip</h2>
                <p>
                At "La Ratonera," we know the best adventures start with a bit of organized chaos. Calculate how long it will take you to save enough money to buy a ticket and survive for a couple of months in your new city, town, or even sewer. Once you have a clear idea of the amount you need, buy the cheapest ticket around your target date and start drafting your resignation letter. Imagine the satisfaction of throwing it in your boss's face, knowing that your job wasn't as important as you thought. Congratulations, if you’re a person with few responsibilities, this moment will taste like glory. Savor it! When the time comes, grab a sturdy, lightweight backpack; forget about heavy suitcases. Don’t stick to a rigid plan; the best experiences are the ones you stumble upon. Pack only the essentials: comfortable clothes, a good pair of walking shoes, and an open mind. Remember, the streets teach more than any travel guide (but no more than this travel guide, streets cannot match this shit)
                </p>
                <span>Pro tip: Pack a few hours before your flight while complaining about always leaving everything to the last minute like the good lazy cunt you are</span>
            <h2>Your first days in your new destination</h2>
                <p>
                The first days in a new destination are for exploring and adapting to the urban jungle. Don’t rush to check into the most expensive hotel; look for the cheapest hostels and dorms then go to some meetups activities to meet new people in your same situation. Walk the streets, talk to locals and try street food; it's cheap and connects you to the essence of the place. At "La Ratonera," we know survival is about adapting, so let your instincts guide you.

            <h2>How to stick to your budget</h2>
                <p>
                Being a frugal traveler is not just a lifestyle; it's an art. Keep an eye on your expenses and always look for the best deal. Shop at local markets instead of expensive restaurants and use public transportation or walk; it’s the best way to get to know the place and save some cash. Share costs with other travelers you meet along the way. At "La Ratonera," we know every penny counts, and true wealth lies in experiences, not material things.
